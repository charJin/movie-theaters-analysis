## Project Background

On July 26, 1896, America's first indoor seated movie theater opened in Louisiana, marking the beginning of a long-standing cultural tradition. 
Since then, movie theaters have been popular gathering places for people to experience films together. 
However, as a non-essential industry, movie theaters are inherently sensitive to economic downturns. 

In recent years, the industry faces additional challenges due to the rapid growth of streaming platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and Hulu.

This project analyzes data, including stock performance and box office gross, to identify key trends and offer insights that may support the theater industry's resilience and growth in the evolving entertainment landscape.

## Executive Summary

From analyzing movie industry data from 2014 to 2024, this project reveals the following:

- **Stock Trends**: Streaming giant Netflix outperformed traditional theater stocks like AMC, Cinemark, and IMAX, with a clear upward trend in subscriber growth and stock value during the pandemic.
- **COVID-19 Impact**: Box office revenue hit its lowest point during COVID-19 but showed signs of recovery post-pandemic. However, it has yet to reach pre-pandemic levels.
- **Movie Viewership Patterns**: Holidays like Christmas and Thanksgiving drive box office revenue significantly, while weekdays like Tuesday show unique trends due to promotions.
