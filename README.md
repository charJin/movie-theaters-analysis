# The Decline of Theaters vs. The Rise of Streaming: Analyzing the Shift in Movie Consumption

## Project Background

On July 26, 1896, America's first indoor seated movie theater opened in Louisiana, marking the beginning of a long-standing cultural tradition. 
Since then, movie theaters have been popular gathering places for people to experience films together. 
However, as a non-essential industry, movie theaters are inherently sensitive to economic downturns. 

In recent years, the industry faces additional challenges due to the rapid growth of streaming platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and Hulu.

This project analyzes data, including stock performance and box office gross, to identify key trends and offer insights that may support the theater industry's resilience and growth in the evolving entertainment landscape.
